Twenty fifteen. Time flies! I typically try to plan my year, personally, around my birthday, with more goal setting around that date. However the gravitas of New Years Day seems to grow with every passing year. Before you know it, we're already 10 days into 2015. A good start to the new year can build momentum that can carry across the days, weeks and months.

## "The beginning is the most important part of the work." -Plato

The start of a new year is a good excuse to finally get a blog going. I've written a few posts for our development blog at [work](http://developers.mobilesystem7.com/), but not posted any kind of personal development blog. I found the writing about process helped with thinking through the task after completing the task. The follow on thought process has helped me in multiple ocassions to create future refactoring tasks.

In hindsight, I should have set this up a long time ago. It's even easier than I had thought. I have spun up small "blog" and project sites with Middleman in the past. But Jekyll and it's GitHub pages integration was even simpler than setting up Middleman.

I look forward to writing about more, non-work, related development projects that I undertake. At this point my vision for *SimplBrew* is as a catalyst for personal development, an excuse to experiment with new languages, frameworks, patterns and projects. Most important, is time to reflect and hopefully share some knowledge and experience.

In the spirit of sharing, here are some resources that I've found helpful to get a Jekyll blog up on GitHub pages, along with some other meta information.
